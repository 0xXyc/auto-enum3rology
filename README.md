# auto-enum3rology
Enumeration automation script best suited for web-based engagements.
Be sure to add your hostname to your /etc/hosts file prior to using. If I am attacking an HTB box, I simply put box_name.htb.
# Usage
`sudo ./enum3rology.sh <ip_address_here> <target_url_here> <target_hostname_here>`
# What does it look like?
Yes, it was my first big automation script, you know I had to make it look cool.
