# auto-enum3rology
This script is a massive work-in-progress and will be changed many, many times. The motivation behind this script is to mash together MY entire enumeration methodology in an effort to save as much time as possible during engagements or in an exam environment. 

## What is the name? 
Enumerology -- Enumeration + Methodology

## Usage
`sudo ./enum3rology.sh <target_ip_address> <target_url> <hostname>`
Be sure to add the target's hostname to /etc/hosts prior to running. If it is a HTB machine, I will usually just do name_of_box.htb.
